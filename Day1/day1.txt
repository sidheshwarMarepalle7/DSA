DSA Learning Journey – Day 1
Topics Covered

--> Introduction to Data Structures – Learned what data structures are and why they are used to organize and manage data efficiently.

--> Types of Data Structures – Explored Linear (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues) and Non-Linear (Trees, Graphs, Hashing) structures.

--> Introduction to Algorithms – Understood that an algorithm is a step-by-step method to solve a problem.

--> Types of Algorithms – Looked at common categories like searching algorithms, sorting algorithms and more.

--> Time Complexity – Learned how to measure the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the number of operations with input size.

--> Space Complexity – Understood how much extra memory an algorithm uses apart from the input.
