DSA Learning Journey – Day 2
Topics Covered

--> Time Complexity (Detailed Study) – Learned how to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size.

--> Types of Time Complexity – Understood best case, worst case, and average case scenarios.

--> Common Time Complexities – Explored Big-O notations like:

--> O(1) → Constant time (e.g., accessing array element).

--> O(log n) → Logarithmic time (e.g., Binary Search).

--> O(n) → Linear time (e.g., Linear Search).

--> O(n log n) → Linearithmic (e.g., Merge Sort).

--> O(n²), O(n³) → Quadratic/Cubic time (e.g., Nested loops).

--> O(2^n), O(n!) → Exponential/Factorial time (e.g., Recursion-heavy problems like Tower of Hanoi, permutations).

--> Space Complexity (Detailed Study) – Learned how to measure memory usage of an algorithm.

--> Components of Space Complexity – Program space includes:

--> Fixed Part → Memory for constants, program instructions, and variables.

--> Variable Part → Memory for dynamic structures, recursion stack, and input data.

Examples

> Iterative programs usually have O(1) space.

> Recursive programs may use O(n) space due to function call stack.

--> Problems:
> Count the frequency of a given number in an array, Time Complexity → O(n), Space Complexity → O(1).
> Find the maximum and minimum element in a single pass, Time Complexity → O(n), Space Complexity → O(1).
