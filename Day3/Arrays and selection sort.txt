DSA Learning Journey – Day 3
--> Topics Covered

-> Arrays – Learned about arrays as a linear data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

-> Array Basics – Accessing, updating, traversing, and performing basic operations like insertion and deletion.

-> Selection Sort – Learned the sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

--> Arrays:
- Array is one data structures of java.
- It is the collection of same data type elements t contigeous memory location.

Selection Sort – Theory

--> Definition: Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the correct position in the sorted portion.

--> How It Works (Step by Step)

1. Start with the first element, assume it is the minimum.

2. Compare it with the rest of the elements to find the actual minimum.

3. Swap the minimum element with the first element.

4. Move to the second position and repeat the process for the remaining unsorted array.

5. Continue until the entire array is sorted.

--> Time Complexity:

> Best Case → O(n²)

> Worst Case → O(n²)

> Average Case → O(n²)

--> Space Complexity: O(1)
