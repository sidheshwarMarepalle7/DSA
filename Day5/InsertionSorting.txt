Day 6- DSA Learning Journey- Insertion sorting

--> Definition:
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

--> How It Works (Step by Step)
1. Assume the first element is already sorted.
2. Pick the next element (key) and compare it with elements in the sorted part.
3. Shift larger elements one position to the right.
4. Insert the key into the correct position.
5. Repeat for all elements until the array is sorted.

--> Complexity Analysis

> Time Complexity:
Best Case → O(n) 
Average Case → O(n²).
Worst Case → O(n²) 

> Space Complexity: O(1)
